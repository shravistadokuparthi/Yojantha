# Yojantha-AI powered access to government Schemes
## Overview:
Yojantha is a full-stack web application that simplifies access to government welfare schemes by intelligently matching citizens with schemes they are eligible for. The platform analyzes user profiles against official scheme criteria and delivers personalized, accurate recommendations through a secure and intuitive interface.
The system aims to bridge the gap between government welfare programs and citizens by reducing awareness barriers, simplifying complex eligibility rules, and preventing missed application deadlines.

## Problem Statement:
The Government of India offers numerous welfare schemes aimed at supporting various sections of society such as students, farmers, women, senior citizens, and economically weaker groups. However, many eligible citizens fail to benefit from these schemes due to lack of awareness, complex eligibility criteria, scattered information sources, and missed deadlines.
Existing platforms largely provide static information without personalized guidance, proactive alerts, or intelligent assistance. This results in underutilization of government resources and missed opportunities for citizens.
There is a need for an intelligent, centralized, and user-friendly platform that can automatically identify eligible schemes, explain them in simple terms, and assist users throughout the application lifecycle.
